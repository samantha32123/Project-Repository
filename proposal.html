    <p>The objective of this website is to analyze the historic coaching, teams, and games that developed the program
        that stands today. Throughout photos, videos, and archives, this website will highlight the foundation of Babson
        Basketball.</p>
    <h2>Who is the target audience?</h2>
    <p>The target audience for this website is current players, future recruits and Babson alumni that are interested in
        knowing more about the program.</p>
    <h2>What content will be included on this website</h2>
    <p>I plan to construct a well-organized layout that hosts different pages with varying types of information. For
        example:
    <ul>
        <li>Photos</li>
        <li>Videos</li>
        <li>Coaching History</li>
        <li>Championship teams</li>
        <li>Personal Testimonials</li>
    </ul>
